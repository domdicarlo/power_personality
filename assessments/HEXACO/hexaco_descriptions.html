<h4>Domain-Level Scales</h4>

<p><i>Honesty-Humility</i>:  Persons with very high scores on the 
Honesty-Humility scale avoid manipulating others for personal gain, feel
 little temptation to break rules, are uninterested in lavish wealth and
 luxuries, and feel no special entitlement to elevated social status.  
Conversely, persons with very low scores on this scale will flatter 
others to get what they want, are inclined to break rules for personal 
profit, are motivated by material gain, and feel a strong sense of 
self-importance.</p>

<p><i>Emotionality</i>: Persons with very high scores on the 
Emotionality scale experience fear of physical dangers, experience 
anxiety in response to life's stresses, feel a need for emotional 
support from others, and feel empathy and sentimental attachments with 
others.  Conversely, persons with very low scores on this scale are not 
deterred by the prospect of physical harm, feel little worry even in 
stressful situations, have little need to share their concerns with 
others, and feel emotionally detached from others.</p>

<p><i>eXtraversion</i>: Persons with very high scores on the 
Extraversion scale feel positively about themselves, feel confident when
 leading or addressing groups of people, enjoy social gatherings and 
interactions, and experience positive feelings of enthusiasm and energy.
  Conversely, persons with very low scores on this scale consider 
themselves unpopular, feel awkward when they are the center of social 
attention, are indifferent to social activities, and feel less lively 
and optimistic than others do.</p>

<p><i>Agreeableness (versus Anger)</i>: Persons with very high scores on
 the Agreeableness scale forgive the wrongs that they suffered, are 
lenient in judging others, are willing to compromise and cooperate with 
others, and can easily control their temper.  Conversely, persons with 
very low scores on this scale hold grudges against those who have harmed
 them, are rather critical of others' shortcomings, are stubborn in 
defending their point of view, and feel anger readily in response to 
mistreatment.</p>

<p><i>Conscientiousness</i>: Persons with very high scores on the 
Conscientiousness scale organize their time and their physical 
surroundings, work in a disciplined way toward their goals, strive for 
accuracy and perfection in their tasks, and deliberate carefully when 
making decisions.  Conversely, persons with very low scores on this 
scale tend to be unconcerned with orderly surroundings or schedules, 
avoid difficult tasks or challenging goals, are satisfied with work that
 contains some errors, and make decisions on impulse or with little 
reflection.</p>

<p><i>Openness to Experience</i>: Persons with very high scores on the 
Openness to Experience scale become absorbed in the beauty of art and 
nature, are inquisitive about various domains of knowledge, use their 
imagination freely in everyday life, and take an interest in unusual 
ideas or people.  Conversely, persons with very low scores on this scale
 are rather unimpressed by most works of art, feel little intellectual 
curiosity, avoid creative pursuits, and feel little attraction toward 
ideas that may seem radical or unconventional.</p>
