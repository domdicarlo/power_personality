                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                
                <p>Theories of social class and social stratification 
suggest a variety of bases for social hierarchies. On an empirical 
basis, different 
                indicators of socioeconomic status each show similar 
graded relationships with health despite the fact that they are only 
moderately 
                interrelated. Education, income and occupation provide 
specific resources. In addition, they locate individuals in relevant 
social 
                hierarchies where relative position may itself be a risk
 or protective factor. The MacArthur Network on SES &amp; Health 
developed a 
                measure of subjective social status to try to capture 
individuals' sense of their place in the social ladder which takes into 
account 
                standing on multiple dimensions of socioeconomic status 
and social position.</p>

                <a name="measurement" id="measurement"></a>
                <h2>Measurement</h2>
                                
                <p>The MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status was 
developed to capture the common sense of social status across the SES 
indicators. 
                In an easy pictorial format, it presents a "social 
ladder" and asks individuals to place an "X" on the rung on which 
                they feel they stand. There are two versions of the 
ladder, one linked to traditional SES indicators 
                (<a href="https://macses.ucsf.edu/research/psychosocial/usladder.php" class="body" target="_blank">SES ladder</a>) and the second linked to standing in one's community 
                (<a href="https://macses.ucsf.edu/research/psychosocial/commladder.php" class="body" target="_blank">community ladder</a>).
 The difference between these two ladders may be of 
                particular interest in poorer communities in which 
individuals may not be high on the SES ladder in terms of income, 
occupation, 
                or education, but may have high standing within their 
social groups such as a religious or local community. Insofar social 
standing 
                has beneficial effects on biological processes related 
to health, standing on the community ladder may be as important as 
standing 
                on the SES ladder. Ideally, it would be best to use both
 ladders (and, if so, one should have participants complete the 
community 
                ladder first so responses to it aren't keyed to the SES 
indicators which are described for the SES ladder). If the research is 
                investigating traditional SES, it will be of particular 
importance to use the SES ladder to be able to make comparisons between 
                objective and subjective SES.</p>

                <h2>Relationship to SES</h2>
                                                
                <p><i>Relationship of objective indicators of SES to the SES ladder.</i></p>
                
                <p>Several studies have examined predictors of the SES 
ladder. We would expect there to be a significant but not perfect 
relationship 
                of traditional indicators of SES (e.g., measures of 
education, individual and family income, occupation and wealth) and 
subjective 
                social status. Ladder rankings should reflect but not be
 redundant with the objective indicators. The SES ladder provides a 
summative 
                measure of social status. Individuals are asked to 
summate across those indicators and each may assign different weights to
 the various 
                components of SES. In addition, people may have a deeper
 understanding of the meaning of their standing on a given aspect of 
SES. Thus 
                just like self-rated health predicts mortality even when
 adjusted for all known objective risk factors (Idler and Benyamini, 
1997), 
                subjective social status may be a "value added" of the 
individual's evaluation of their status and the actual implications of 
the objective 
                indicators. For example, measures of educational 
attainment treat "high school graduation" as the same value whether one 
graduated from 
                an elite prep school or an inner city high school, and 
"college graduation" the same for graduation from a top-ranked college 
or a 
                diploma-mill. Yet the life chances of these graduates 
are quite different and are likely to be more sensitively captured by 
the ladder 
                ranking than by the rather crude educational levels.</p>
                
                <p>Whitehall II Study of British civil servants SES 
ladder scores are predicted by employment grade, education, household 
and personal 
                income, household wealth, satisfaction with standard of 
living, and feelings of financial security. Childhood SES is also 
related to 
                ladder ranking. Education and income are more strongly 
related to objective SES (as assessed by occupational grade) while a 
feeling of 
                financial security is more strongly related to 
subjective SES as assessed by the SES ladder. Childhood SES and wealth 
are almost equally 
                related to objective and subjective SES. Singh-Manoux, 
Marmot, Adler, (2005) suggest that the stronger association between 
subjective SES 
                and the feeling of financial security in this 
middle-aged cohort suggests that subjective SES provides a better 
assessment of a person's 
                future prospects, opportunities, and resources than 
objective SES.</p>
                
                <p>In the US, predictors differ for White and Black 
participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults 
(CARDIA). 
                Financial security, material deprivation and education 
are significant predictors of ranking on the SES ladder for both white 
and 
                black participants. However, household income and wealth
 predict subjective social status for Whites in CARDIA but not for 
Blacks 
                (Adler, Singh-Manoux, Schwartz, Stewart, Matthews &amp; 
Marmot, 2008). Unlike the results in Whitehall II where psychosocial 
                factors were not related to ladder scores, in CARDIA 
ladder rankings were associated with optimism for both groups, and with 
control 
                in Whites and mental health for Blacks.</p>
                
                <p><i>Qualitative investigation of criteria used for SES ladder rankings.</i>
 In an exploratory qualitative study done for the 
                MacArthur Network, Snibbe, Stewart &amp; Adler (in 
preparation 2007) explored the criteria people say they use to decide 
their position 
                on the SES and Community ladders. In an interview, 60 
participants in the CARDIA study narrated how they ranked themselves on 
the SES ladder.</p>
                                
				<p align="right"><a href="#top" class="body">back to top</a></p>

                <p>The most frequently mentioned source of subjective 
social status on the SES ladder was material wealth, mentioned by over 
90% of 
                participants (however about a fifth of participants also
 rejected materialism). The next most frequently mentioned sources of 
subjective 
                social status were occupation (72%) and education (62%).
 Almost a quarter of participants indicated using their spirituality or 
ethical 
                values, and a fifth of the sample used the extent to 
which they give to others and their health as considerations when 
determining 
                ranking on the SES ladder. It is not surprising that 
respondents thought about financial, educational and occupational 
standing in 
                answering the question of where they stand on the SES 
ladder since these are the dimensions the scale specifically mentions. 
The categories 
                of ethics/spirituality, health and social responsibility
 or altruism ("giving") which were spontaneously generated have more to 
do with 
                personal qualities and a subjective sense of self-worth 
than objective markers of status. As indicated such factors may play a 
not 
                insignificant role in subjective social status.</p>
                
                <p><i>Definition of "community" and criteria used for Community ladder rankings.</i>
 In addition to the SES ladder a second ladder 
                asks people to indicate how they stand in their 
communities. No criteria are given either for the nature of community or
 the dimensions 
                of status to be used. The qualitative analyses revealed 
that the majority of participants defined community as their 
neighborhood (57%). 
                Significantly more African American participants (80%) 
than European American participants (33.33%) used this definition. The 
next most 
                popular definition of community was city or town (37%), 
followed by religious groups (22%), social supporters (20%), workplace 
(18%), 
                family (18%), friends (12%), people who share their 
interests (12%), their region (12%), and, finally the nation or world 
(10%). Additionally, 
                almost half of the participants generated idiosyncratic 
definitions of community that did not fit in any one category. There 
were no gender or 
                race differences in mentions of categories other than 
"neighborhood."</p>
                
                <p>Unlike their responses to the SES ladder, 
participants relied little on their wealth (25%), education (7%), or 
occupation (22%) when 
                deciding where to place themselves on the Community 
ladder. Instead, they most frequently mentioned the everyday ways they 
give to 
                others—as volunteers, as donors, as good citizens, and 
as good neighbors with close to 87% mentioning participation in giving 
                activities. A second frequently mentioned source of 
subjective social status was how well-liked or respected they are by 
others (52%), 
                followed closely by admissions of feeling as if they do 
not give enough to their community (50%). (Interestingly, "being 
respected" 
                was a high frequency content code for the Community 
ladder but not for the SES ladder.) The remaining categories, in order 
of frequency, 
                were giving as a leader (37%), giving as a parent (32%),
 and 12% rejected materialism as contributing to Community subjective 
social status. 
                Health was not mentioned as a source of subjective 
social status on the Community ladder as it had been on the SES ladder.</p>
                
                <p>Analyses of the Community ladder narratives revealed 
that more African American (36.67%) than European American (13.33%) 
participants 
                mentioned materials / money, and conversely, more 
European American (13.33%) than African American (0.00%) participants 
mentioned education. 
                Finally, a trend-level effect showed that more African 
Americans (33.33%) mentioned spirituality and ethics than did European 
Americans. 
                The best predictor of the Community ladder rankings was 
SES ladder ranking, which alone explained 33% of the variance with two 
of the 
                "giving" variables—giving as a parent and complaining of
 not being active enough—increasing the explained variance to 47%.</p>
                                
				<p align="right"><a href="#top" class="body">back to top</a></p>

                <p>The qualitative study gives some hints about answers 
to important questions such as how people define community and what 
dimensions 
                they use in placing themselves on the Community ladder.</p>
                
                <p><i>Relationship of the SES and Community ladders.</i>
 To date relatively little research has been done using the Community 
ladder. In 
                the few studies where both ladders have been used they 
have been found to be correlated. Goldman, Cornman and Chang (2006) in a
 Taiwanese 
                sample showed that although the two ladders were highly 
correlated (with a Pearson correlation, equal to the Spearman rank 
correlation of 
                0.78), their sample of middle-aged and older Taiwanese 
residents ranked their social position within their community an average
 of 0.4-rung 
                higher than they ranked their position within Taiwan. 
Analyses of ladder rankings from CARDIA at the Year l5 exam show the two
 ladders were 
                correlated 0.54. In this group of over 3,000 
participants African-American men and women ranked themselves an average
 of 0.92 rungs higher 
                on the Community than SES ladders whereas 
European-American men and women demonstrated more similar SES and 
Community ratings, 0.19 and 
                0.34 differences respectively (personal communication

                <h2>Relationship to Health</h2>
                
                <p>A growing literature is emerging on the linkage 
between subjective socioeconomic status and health. The SES ladder has 
been 
                used in a number of studies with populations that range 
from British civil servants (Singh-Manoux, Adler &amp; Marmot, 2003; 
                Singh-Manoux, Marmot &amp; Adler, 2005), to pregnant 
women from four different US ethnic groups (Ostrove, Adler, Kuppermann 
                &amp; Washington, 2000), to adolescents in the US 
Midwest (Goodman, Adler, Kawachi, Frazier, Huang &amp; Colditz, 2001; 
Goodman, 
                Adler, Daniels, Morrison, Slap &amp; Dolan, 2003; 
Goodman, McEwen, Dolan, Schafer-Kalkhoff &amp; Adler, 2005), to elderly 
residents 
                of Taiwan (Hu, Adler, Goldman, Weinstein &amp; Seeman, 
2005), to residents of small towns in three provinces in China (Yip 
&amp; 
                Adler, 2005), to low-income rural Mexicans (Jamison, J.,
 Fernald, L., Burke, H., &amp; Adler, N.E., July 2005), to older retired
 
                residents of Britain (Wright &amp; Steptoe, 2005) and 
representative samples of individuals in the United States (Operario, 
Adler 
                &amp; Williams, 2004), and Hungary (Kopp, Skrabski, 
Rethelyi, Kawachi &amp; Adler, 2004; Kopp, Skrabski, Kawachi &amp; 
Adler, 2005). 
                The results have shown that subjective status is related
 to a range of health indicators, including poor self-rated health, 
higher 
                mortality, depression, cardiovascular risk, diabetes and
 respiratory illness. For example, in the Whitehall II Studies of 
British 
                civil servants higher SES ladder scores were associated 
for men and women with lower prevalence of angina, diabetes, GHQ 
depression, 
                and better perceived general health. Higher SES ladder 
scores were also associated with lower prevalence for men of respiratory
 problems.</p>
                                
				<p align="right"><a href="#top" class="body">back to top</a></p>

                <p>In several of the studies subjective status showed a 
stronger relationship with the health indicators than did objective 
status 
                and remained significant when objective indicators of 
SES were entered simultaneously into analytic models. In one study, for 
example, 
                the ladder metric did a better job of predicting heart 
rate, body fat distribution, and cortisol responses to stress than did 
objective 
                SES measures ( Adler, Epel, Castellazzo, &amp; Ickovics,
 2000). Other studies show that the relationship between the ladder and 
health 
                outcomes remains robust even when researchers 
statistically control for objective SES indicators (Ostrove, Adler, 
Kuppermann, &amp; 
                Washington, 2000; Singh-Manoux, Adler, &amp; Marmot, 
2003). In the Whitehall study of British civil servants, subjective 
social status 
                predicted change in health status even controlling for 
occupational grade (Singh-Manoux, Marmot, Adler, 2005). Wright &amp; 
Steptoe 
                (2005) showed that the impact of subjective social 
status on the cortisol response to awakening was independent of age, 
body mass index, 
                smoking, time of waking, educational qualifications, 
financial strain, number of chronic illnesses and medication count in an
 older 
                retired sample. They note that in older adults, 
subjective social status may be particularly useful in providing an 
aggregate estimate 
                of lifetime social experience not so effectively 
captured by objective markers of SES.</p>
                
                <p><i>Differences by race/ethnicity.</i> Although the 
ladder has been used with a variety of samples, there is some evidence 
that it 
                may not operate in the same way for all groups. Ostrove,
 etal (2000) found that subjective SES was significantly related to 
self-rated 
                health among four groups of women (White, Chinese 
American, African American and Latina). Subjective social status was a 
significant 
                predictor of self-rated health after the effects of 
objective indicators were accounted for among White and Chinese American
 women, 
                however, among African American and Latina women, 
household income was the only significant predictor of self-rated 
health. After 
                accounting for the effects of subjective social status 
on health, objective indicators made no additional contribution to 
explaining 
                health among White and Chinese American women however 
household income continued to predict health after accounting for 
subjective social 
                status among Latina and African American women.</p>
                
                <p><i>What the ladders are capturing.</i> The research 
to date provides evidence that the ladder ratings are picking up 
something 
                meaningful for health, but it is not clear what these 
ratings reflect. One concern, of course, is whether these ratings are 
simply 
                reflections of other variables with which they are 
confounded. There are two plausible types of variables which could 
account for 
                an association of ladder scores and health outcomes.</p>
                
                <p>One potential confounder is response bias. It could 
be that individuals who rate themselves high on the ladder also report 
better 
                health because of a response set or social desirability.
 If so, we would expect to find associations of ladder rankings with 
self-rated 
                variables, such as global health, but not with variables
 measured independently, such as physiological functioning or mortality.
 Ladder 
                scores show significant associations with both types of 
variables suggesting that response bias alone cannot account for the 
association 
                of subjective social status and health. In addition 
Singh-Manoux etal (2005) showed that ladder rankings predicted global 
health 3 years 
                later, controlling for global health status as assessed 
at initial measurement. Since this controls for the shared variance of 
subjective 
                social status and self-rated global health, the 
prediction of subsequent global health ratings would be independent of 
any shared 
                association due to response bias or other confounders.</p>
                                
				<p align="right"><a href="#top" class="body">back to top</a></p>

                <p>A second potential confounder is negative affect. 
Individuals who are depressed or who experience negative affect may both
 rate 
                themselves low on the ladder and rate their health as 
poor. There is a relationship between ladder scores and negative affect 
and 
                depression. However, it appears that this is more likely
 to be due to the influence of low subjective status on affect than vice
 
                verse. As above, findings from studies with outcomes 
that are not self-report and the longitudinal study suggest that 
negative affect 
                is not a major confounder. In addition, several studies 
demonstrate a significant association of ladder rankings with self-rated
 
                health even when negative affect is controlled for. 
Operario, etal (2000) found that negative affect was not only related to
 
                subjective SES but also to objective SES indicators. 
Moreover, when adjusted for negative affect, both objective and 
subjective SES 
                showed somewhat weaker associations with global health. 
This is consistent with a mediational model in which both objective and 
                subjective status affect health in part by increasing 
negative affect.</p>
                
                <p>Given that the SES ladder shows robust associations 
with health which are not simply due to confounding with response style 
or 
                negative affect, it is important to know what the ladder
 rankings are capturing. Below we discuss quantitative and qualitative 
approaches 
                to that question.</p>

                <h2>Network Usage</h2>
                
                <p>The SES ladder has become an integral measure in 
network research. We receive many requests to use the ladder in 
non-network research. 
                Nancy Adler has consulted on the majority of studies 
noted in this review. New versions of the ladders, for example, for 
research with 
                adolescents, and Spanish and Hungarian translation have 
been developed in the last few years.</p>
