Study Title: Personality, Relationships, and Academic Performance

PI: Prof. Dario Maestripieri

IRB Study Number: 19-0972





Informed Consent Document


We are asking you to participate in a research study.  Please read the information below and feel free to ask any questions that you may have.

 

A.  Project Description



1.  In this study, you will be asked to complete a number of questionnaires related to your personality, social experience, and interests, to participate in experimental tests that may include eye tracking, video recording, reading and responding to social scenarios, measuring handgrip strength, and providing saliva samples for hormonal analysis. One experimental task may involve a 10-min video-recorded interview, while the other tasks will involve computerized tests of cognitive performance and decision-making. 



2.  We will collect saliva to analyze these samples for hormones that are related to reactions to social interactions and performance reactions in the body.



3. You will be asked to fill out some questionnaires before coming into the lab. This should take about 30-45 minutes.



4.  The estimated time to complete the in-lab study is approximately 60 minutes during one session. 



5.  All study procedures will take place at 940 East 57th Street (Biopsychological Sciences Building).



6.  The research is being conducted with the goal of publication in an academic journal and presentation at academic conferences.



7.  You will be compensated for your participation with either $20 in cash or 2 SONA credits.

 

B.  Risks and Benefits



1.  Your participation in this study does not involve any physical risk or emotional risk to you beyond the risks of daily life. You can stop participating at any time should you feel uncomfortable or want to stop your involvement in the research study.



2.  You are not likely to have any direct benefit from being in this research study. This study is designed to help us learn more about relationships and decision making. The study results may be used to help other people in the future.

 

C.  Confidentiality



1.  Results of this study may be used in publications and presentations. Your study data will be handled as confidentially as possible. Your name or other identifiers will not be attached to your answers so that your confidentiality can be maintained. Your privacy will be ensured in that all data resulting from this study will be analyzed, written, and published and/or presented in aggregate form.



2.  Video recorded and still photo information will not be used in future studies unless you give explicit permission for this below. If permission is given, your name will never be attached to this information. 



3.  We may share the data we collect from you for use in future research studies or with other researchers – if we share the data that we collect about you, we will remove any information that could identify you before we share it.



4.  Saliva samples will be destroyed two years after they are analyzed for hormonal concentrations – the saliva samples will not be used in other research studies and will not be shared beyond the research team for this study. 

 

D. Your Rights as a Research Participant



1.  Participation in this study is voluntary.  If at any time and for any reason, you would prefer not to participate in this study, please feel free not to. You may withdraw from this study at any time, and you will not be penalized for deciding to stop participation.  



2.  If you decide to withdraw from this study, the researchers will ask you if the information already collected from you can be used.



3.  If you are a University of Chicago student or employee, deciding not to participate in this study, or to stop participation, will not affect your class standing, grades, employment, or any other aspects of your relationship with the University of Chicago.

My grades at this school were not very good not only because of the rigor but also because I suffer from depression. In high school I had a 3.7 GPA and since taking community college classes I have gotten mostly A's. ,488
